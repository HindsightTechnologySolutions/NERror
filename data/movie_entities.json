In fact, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/io9s-guide-to-all-the-movies-you-should-give-a-damn-abo-1840780568\">some of our most anticipated</a> superhero, fantasy, sci-fi, and horror films are directed by women. Imagine that! Not all of these are being released this year, but here are 14 films to put on your radar if they're not already. We've been fans of Banks ever since seeing her in 2001's <em>Wet Hot American Summer </em>and 2005's <em>The 40 Year Old Virgin (</em>also, shout out to <em>Sliver, Moonbeam City</em>, and all those fashion sins committed by Effie Trinket in the <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-hunger-games-pulls-a-star-wars-with-its-prequel-her-1841133188\"><em>Hunger Games</em></a><em> </em>movies). But our favorite thing about her is fast becoming the fact that while she's obviously hilarious in front of the camera, she's also branched out into directing. Though we (and <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/charlies-angels-box-office-flop-1203407429/\" >a lot of people, apparently</a>) skipped <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/in-the-new-charlies-angels-trailer-bad-girls-never-loo-1838968066\">her recent take on <em>Charlie's Angels</em></a>, we're more than intrigued to see her entry into the world of Universal Monsters, which will reportedly take the form of an <em>Invisible Woman</em> movie that she'll also star in, from a script by Erin Cressida Wilson <em>(Secretary)</em>. (Release date TBD) Does the world really need another <em>Cinderella</em> movie? How about one where Idina Menzel plays the stepmother and Billy Porter plays the fairy godmother? Though this somehow isn't a Disney production (probably because <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/cinderella-is-an-insane-guilty-pleasure-but-you-should-1691289516#!\">the Mouse just did its own live-action </a><a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/cinderella-is-an-insane-guilty-pleasure-but-you-should-1691289516#!\"><em>Cinderella</em></a><em> </em>in 2015), and its twist on the fairy tale comes courtesy of <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/cats-review-i-have-seen-sights-no-human-should-see-1840507030\">James Corden</a> (hopefully there are <em>no </em>cats involved), we're still intrigued to see this musical interpretation of the well-worn story. Pop star <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/camila-cabello-star-cinderella-imagining-1200283\" >Camila Cabello has the lead</a>, and Menzel and Porter are inspired casting, but Cannon (whose writing credits include <em>Pitch Perfect</em> and <em>30 Rock</em>; her previous feature was the raunchy comedy <em>Blockers</em>) behind the camera could be the key element that makes this latest <em>Cinderella</em> be more than just another overload of sweet stuff. (2021) Caro's breakout film, 2002's <em>Whale Rider</em>, is set in her native New Zealand and tells the story of a M'ori girl (Keisha Castle-Hughes, who was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar) who proves she has what it takes to be the leader of her tribe. Though Caro's made some other films since then, none have been as high-profile as Disney's upcoming <em>Mulan</em>. It's a live-action remake that\u2013unlike certain <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-lion-king-is-a-gorgeous-but-completely-unnecessary-1836244494\">other recent</a> Disney <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/aladdin-made-me-feel-like-a-kid-again-1834903211\">live-action redos</a>\u2013<a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/mulan-is-no-man-in-her-movies-new-powerful-trailer-1840234705\">actually feels like</a> it'll have <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/new-footage-from-mulan-was-filled-with-a-whirlwind-of-e-1837542561\">something new to bring to the table</a> beyond cashing in on nostalgia (including, but not limited to, a cast that includes Donnie Yen and Jet Li). When Disney hired her in 2017, Caro became <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/disneys-live-action-mulan-has-a-female-director-which-1792360542\">one of very few woman</a> in Hollywood to helm a film budgeted over $100 million; you'll find other trailblazers in that arena also making this list. (March 27) Chapman has already smashed through several glass ceilings in animation; in 1998, she co-directed <em>The Prince of Egypt</em> (becoming the first woman to direct an animated feature for a major studio), and in 2012 she co-directed<em> Brave</em>, which went on to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Film (making her the first woman to win that award, a year before Jennifer Lee took home the same for <em>Frozen</em>). <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-co-director-of-brave-is-making-an-alice-in-wonderla-1776135855\">Chapman's live-action directorial debut</a>, <em>Come Away</em>, shares some of the fanciful DNA of her previous works, with a twist; it imagines that the title characters of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> and <em>Peter Pan</em> are siblings helping each other through a family tragedy. It'll premiere at <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/21-intriguing-sundance-movies-that-could-become-2020s-s-1840981793\">Sundance this week</a>, with hopefully a wider release to follow. (January 24) In case there's any confusion, Jordan Peele isn't directing the new <em>Candyman</em> film <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/jordan-peele-reflects-on-the-cultural-relevancy-of-us-1833421331\">described as the \"spiritual sequel\"</a> to the 1992 horror cult classic, set in contemporary <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-candyman-remake-may-have-found-another-one-of-its-s-1833010876\">gentrified Chicago</a>, though he did co-write it and is co-producing. The director of <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/jordan-peele-confirms-candyman-sequel-with-nia-dacosta-1830692675\">this summer's <em>Candyman</em> is Brooklyn-born DaCosta</a>\u2013whose debut film, thriller <em>Little Woods</em>, came out last year and stars Tessa Thompson as a woman trying, without much success, to leave her life as a small-time criminal behind. The cast of <em>Candyman </em>will be led by <em>Watchmen</em>'s <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/our-new-candyman-is-probably-aquamans-yahya-abdul-matee-1832903761\">Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</a>\u2013said to be playing the adult version of the baby named Anthony who plays a big part in the events of the 1992 movie\u2013and, hopefully, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-new-candyman-could-feature-a-wild-return-after-all-1838596113\">O.G. bee man Tony Todd</a>. <em>Candyman</em> is still terrifying nearly 30 years later, and given the still-sharp social commentary lurking beneath its <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/13-horror-and-fantasy-movies-and-tv-shows-inspired-by-u-1822682590\">urban-legends-are-real</a> plot, it feels like a story ripe for updating on many levels. (June 12) There's no denying that DuVernay is a towering talent, especially when you take into account her non-genre works <em>(Selma, 13th, When They See Us)</em>. We may not have fallen in love with <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-wrinkle-in-time-tries-to-soar-but-has-trouble-stayin-1823575964\">her interpretation of <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em></a>, but it nailed the necessary balance of character development and dazzling visuals, which makes us more than excited to see what she'll bring <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/holy-shit-ava-duvernay-is-directing-dcs-new-gods-movie-1823813757\">to the much-anticipated New Gods film</a> she's making <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/ava-duvernays-co-writer-on-new-gods-will-be-none-other-1835106578\">with co-writer Tom King</a>. So far plot details <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/ava-duvernay-teases-a-few-familiar-faces-for-the-new-go-1836774511\">have only been teased</a> and there has been no casting announcement (though <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/open-channel-cast-oscar-isaac-as-any-character-ever-1828636673\">here's an idea</a>)\u2013this thing doesn't even have a release date yet. But 2020 should bring us a lot more information about this undeniably thrilling project. (Release date TBD) Um, duh. <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-wonder-woman-movie-is-even-better-than-you-hoped-it-1795443763\">We loved <em>Wonder Woman</em></a>. Jenkins squashed any doubts that a woman could successfully helm a giant comic-book extravaganza\u2013one with a long-overdue female lead, no less\u2013with a film full of action, heart, and <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-ultimate-wonder-woman-analysis-by-the-women-of-io9-1795760084\">goosebump-raising moments</a>. We've been <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/wonder-woman-1984-has-been-pushed-back-7-months-1829914671\">counting down the minutes</a> until the arrival of the colorfully retro <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em>, which <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/breaking-down-the-struggles-and-shiny-armors-of-wonder-1840324597\">shows every sign</a> of becoming another instant classic with Jenkins once again calling the shots.<em> </em>(June 5) Truth be told, the main Joy project we're looking forward to this year is <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-new-westworld-teaser-unveils-date-of-the-season-3-pre-1840972263\">the return of HBO's <em>Westworld</em></a>. Our obsession with <em>Westworld</em> is, in turn, the reason we're so intrigued by <em>Reminiscence</em>, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/hugh-jackson-may-star-in-lisa-joys-big-screen-directori-1832203989\">the sci-fi feature film</a> she's currently working on as writer-director, with a cast that's said to include Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Ferguson, and <em>Westworld</em>'s Thandie Newton, among others. Set in a near-future Miami after the effects of global warming have submerged much of the city, the film's plot involves the use of technology that helps people relive their pasts, for better and for worse. (Release date TBD) It was all but inevitable that <em>The Craft </em><a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/looks-like-a-new-version-of-the-craft-is-moving-forward-1833572043\">would get a remake</a>\u2013it contains <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/we-inducted-a-new-member-into-the-crafts-coven-1829967446\">so many things that people love</a>, like 1990s fashion, high school angst, and witchcraft!\u2013but we're glad to see Blumhouse's do-over will explore this tale of female empowerment (that spirals into a cautionary tale about the abuse of said power) from an actual woman's point of view. Lister-Jones is an actor whose segue into directing started with 2017's <em>Band Aid</em>, a dramedy she made <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/06/zoe-lister-jones-band-aid.html\" >using an all-female crew</a>. While we don't know much about how Lister-Jones will update the script for her version of the cult classic, the casting thus far suggests this <em>Craft</em> will be, refreshingly, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-craft-remake-has-found-the-rest-of-its-weirdos-mis-1838261854\">far more diverse</a> than the original film. (Release date TBD) One of the most anticipated <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/heres-every-genre-film-netflix-just-announced-for-2020-1840809794\">Netflix movies of 2020</a> has gotta be <em>The Old Guard</em>, about which the streamer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NetflixFilm/status/1213221197531377666\" >recently tweeted</a>: \"Charlize Theron and Kiki Layne lead a covert group of immortal mercenaries who must fight to keep their team together when they discover the existence of a new immortal and their extraordinary abilities are exposed.\" Director Prince-Bythewood's name was, at one point, attached to <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-spider-man-spinoff-silver-and-black-is-coming-in-fe-1797769723\">Sony's yet-to-materialize Spider-Man spinoff <em>Silver and Black</em></a>, but <em>The Old Guard</em>\u2013an adaptation of Greg Rucka and Leandro Fernandez's Image Comics title\u2013is her first full-on action movie (her previous films include <em>Love and Basketball, The Secret Life of Bees, </em>and the Gugu Mbatha-Raw-starring<em> Beyond the Lights</em>). Frankly, <em>The Old Guard </em>had us at \"Charlize Theron\" and \"immortal mercenaries,\" but the rest of that plot description (and <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>'s Kiki Layne) will make it difficult not to tune in when it hits Netflix. (2020) Director Shortland has made several films in her native Australia, but <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/black-widows-first-trailer-promises-a-deadly-family-reu-1840168559\">Marvel's </a><a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/black-widows-first-trailer-promises-a-deadly-family-reu-1840168559\"><em>Black Widow</em></a><em> </em>is definitely <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/marvel-studios-has-its-black-widow-director-cate-short-1827557062\">her first potential blockbuster</a>, as well as the first Marvel film to be directed solo by a woman (<em>Captain Marvel</em>, of course, was <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/captain-marvels-directors-discuss-the-importance-of-the-1833208871\">co-directed by Anna Boden</a> and Ryan Fleck). <em>Black Widow </em>is only the second Marvel film to focus on a female hero (after, again, <em>Captain Marvel</em>), but it won't be introducing a new character\u2013obviously, we've gotten to know the Scarlett Johansson version <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/black-widow-this-is-why-we-can-t-have-nice-things-1702333037\">over several <em>Avengers</em> films</a> and even saw her die in <em>Endgame</em>. Um, but however unsatisfying Natasha Romanoff's story has been up to this point, her <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/kevin-feige-hints-at-how-a-black-widow-prequel-could-re-1835656005\">prequel film</a> looks like it'll deliver not just an origin story (far beyond what we already know) for the assassin, but also killer action, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-latest-black-widow-footage-asks-who-is-hell-that-gu-1840985439\">a mysterious villain</a>, and maybe even some much-deserved fun. (May 1) Chinese-American filmmaker Yan made her feature debut with Shanghai-set dark comedy <em>Dead Pigs</em>, which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, but <em>Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</em> is set to share her talents with a much larger audience. Written by Christina Hodson (2018's <em>Bumblebee</em>), <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/roller-derby-harley-quinn-bathtub-hyenas-and-more-wil-1840899734\"><em>Birds of Prey</em></a> follows the continuing adventures of DC Comics antihero Harley Quinn, with Margot Robbie reprising her role from <em>Suicide Squad</em> in what looks to be <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/birds-of-prey-is-bringing-together-more-than-the-iconic-1840269820\">a much more female-centric story</a>. Along for the ride: Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), and baddie Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), plus plenty of roller skates, baseball bats, and <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-costume-designer-for-birds-of-prey-dishes-on-harley-1840710445\">a colorful wardrobe</a> that appears equally suited to kicking ass and strutting the catwalk. (February 7) We're just gonna keep calling it <em>The Matrix 4</em> until someone divulges what will probably be a much flashier title, but we couldn't be more stoked about the re-teaming of <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/lana-wachowski-is-helming-the-matrix-4-with-keanu-reev-1837416713\">Lana Wachowski, Keanu Reeves, and Carrie-Anne Moss</a>, set to be released 22 years after the original film changed action movies forever. We don't know any plot details, but we do know Neo and Trinity will return, with new faces reportedly to include the busy <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-matrix-4-is-uploading-aquaman-and-us-star-yahya-abd-1838911223\">Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</a> and <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/report-neil-patrick-harris-is-entering-the-matrix-4-1839070839?_ga=2.129142216.558144254.1575835759-1597414124.1522872342\">Neil Patrick Harris</a>, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-purge-brings-back-a-familiar-face-and-more-updates-1840298261\">among others</a>. (<a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-4th-matrix-will-arrive-before-the-flash-1840371916\">May 21, 2021</a>) The director of the critically acclaimed contemporary Western <em>The Rider</em> was <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/reports-marvels-eternals-movie-is-moving-forward-with-1829230370\">tapped to helm</a> Marvel's <em>The Eternals</em> in September 2018, and the project has since become one of fall's most anticipated releases (not just because of the <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/valkyrie-wont-be-the-first-lgbtq-character-in-the-marve-1837595363\">promised inclusion of Marvel's first major gay character</a>, but that's definitely something worth looking forward to). Zhao has <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/marvels-eternals-are-angelina-jolie-salma-hayek-richa-1836416851\">an all-star cast</a> helping to bring the cosmic Jack Kirby comics to life, including <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/new-photos-of-the-eternals-cast-tease-a-dramatic-mcu-fi-1837967934\">Angelina Jolie</a>, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/in-case-of-acting-emergency-break-glass-to-recast-with-1837178641\">and</a> <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/captain-marvels-gemma-chan-may-pull-mcu-double-duty-wit-1836980965\">others</a>. (November 6) The list doesn't end there, thank goodness. We've also got our eye on Deborah Chow (the <em>Mandalorian</em> alum who'll be overseeing <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/deborah-chow-explains-why-the-new-obi-wan-story-is-way-1840033985\">the Obi-Wan Kenobi series for Disney+</a>, and\u2013crazy idea\u2013maybe a <em>Star Wars</em> feature one day?), Domee Shi (creator of <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/pixars-stunning-heartwarming-short-bao-is-now-availabl-1831184203\">Pixar's first female-directed short</a>, the Oscar-winning <em>Bao</em>), Issa L\u00f3pez (who directed last year's Guillermo del Toro-beloved horror film <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/issa-lopez-on-the-horrors-of-tigers-are-not-afraid-her-1837182376\"><em>Tigers Are Not Afraid</em></a>), and Blumhouse <em>Into the Dark</em> horror alums <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/director-sophia-takal-talks-blumhouse-and-her-episode-o-1831298857\">Sophia Takal</a> (<em>Black Christmas</em>) and <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/hulus-into-the-dark-takes-on-the-border-crisis-in-its-m-1835995157\">Gigi Saul Guerrero</a>.

It touted a release date of April 13, 2018. Fast forward over two years. On January 6, 2020, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/new-mutants-is-finally-getting-a-new-trailer-1840712406?_ga=2.205129878.742561543.1577988902-1597414124.1522872342\">another trailer for the film</a> will drop, this time touting an April 3, 2020 release date. In that time, the tale of Josh Boone's <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/what-the-new-mutants-comics-can-tell-us-about-the-movie-1819454452?_ga=2.29019194.742561543.1577988902-1597414124.1522872342\">little X-Men spinoff</a>, <em>The New Mutants</em>, has become a beacon of movie blog gossip. The prevailing, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/there-are-apparently-very-sensible-reasons-for-pushing-1824125079\">albeit it never officially confirmed</a>, rumors are that Fox was initially happy with Boone's first cut of the film, describing it as almost a young adult, creepy <em>Breakfast Club</em> meets <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next </em>with superheroes. However, this coincided with the uber-success of another film starring several kids, <em>It: Chapter One.</em> Reportedly the studio wanted to follow-up on that success and retool <em>New Mutants </em>to lean a bit more into its horror elements. As a result, the film was delayed so that a huge bulk of it could be changed through reshoots. But, again, none of that was ever actually confirmed. It just became the prevailing theory because no one refuted it. Along the way, its April 13, 2018 release date got moved to February 22, 2019. Then it was August 2, 2019. Then <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-disney-fox-deal-is-officially-complete-1833437912\">Fox was purchased by Disney</a>. All of a sudden releasing a teen X-Men spinoff became slightly problematic considering there's the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe thing to take into consideration. The stars of the film, such as Maisie Williams, went on record <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/new-mutants-reshoots-havent-happened-and-its-stars-are-1833580537\">saying those reported horror reshoots never actually happened</a> and the resulting confusion even sprouted rumors that the film could be pushed to streaming services like Disney+ or Hulu, especially when <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/features/fox-disney-earnings-dark-phoenix-stuber-racing-in-the-rain-1203300260/\" >Variety</a> reported Disney was \"unimpressed\" with the film and believed \"it has limited box office potential.\" Now it appears all of that may be settled. Disney has since slapped an April 3, 2020 release date on the film and earlier this week, Boone took to his Instagram to <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/there-s-a-new-trailer-for-new-mutants-coming-next-month-1840597635?_ga=2.234695960.742561543.1577988902-1597414124.1522872342\">promote a new trailer</a>. The language there, \"supervised by,\" seems a little odd and things only get weirder in the comments where a fan asked, \"Will this be the og version of the movie you shot?\" and Boone replied, \"I wouldn't be promoting it here if it wasn't.\" Many have taken Boone's reply to confirm that the original, unaltered version of <em>The New Mutants</em> is what fans will see in theaters this year. io9 sent multiple requests to Boone's listed representatives for clarification and did not get a response. Disney, which now owns Fox, would not offer any comment, and we reached out to Boone on his Instagram as well. We'll update if we are able to. Still, all things considered, an original, unaltered version does seem to be what Boone is suggesting.

But it looks like some of those rules were already being conveniently bypassed. According to the <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12333398\" >New Zealand Herald</a>, Economic Developer Minister Phil Twyford said that New Zealand's Cabinet has issued several travel exemptions using a little-known category for foreigner arrivals in the country who are considered key workers for projects of \"significant economic value.\" That means hundreds of non-Kiwis have been getting around the country's strict travel ban for over a month now. It's a power the Cabinet granted Twyford on April 21. Since then, he's used it for a \"couple of hundred\" in several critical industries, including energy and water infrastructure. Twyford wouldn't comment specifically on whether Hollywood studios have been included, saying it'd be \"inappropriate\" to discuss, but it would seem that they are. <em>Avatar</em> producer Jon Landau <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/indiana-jones-5-director-james-mangold-discusses-his-ap-1843641364\">recently announced</a> that he was returning to New Zealand this week to resume production.

In a post on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAdy0QNpwLP/\" >Instagram</a>, Avatar producer Jon Landau shared that he was preparing to return to New Zealand with a production crew this week, along with a photo of one of the sets. Landau <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/417403/avatar-producer-jon-landau-on-his-return-to-new-zealand\" >told Radio NZ</a> production will be employing the same people they were already working with in New Zealand, but will also be bringing in crew from overseas\u2013albeit a smaller team than before. \"We feel we're coming back to the safest place in the world possible, thanks to a team of people that we've worked with.,\" Landau said. \"We believe we have a very thoughtful, detailed and diligent safety plan that will keep everybody as safe as possible in these unprecedented times.\" Even though Twyford said everyone who's been admitted to the country has had to undergo quarantine or managed self-isolation, the revelation of the exemptions have received criticism from New Zealand residents\u2013mainly because the government is already in a bit of hot water for how it's unevenly implemented some travel restrictions. Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/415758/no-exemptions-from-border-rules-given-on-compassionate-grounds\" >it was reported</a> that over two dozen people had requested \"compassion exemptions\" to leave their quarantines early to visit loved ones on their deathbeds and all were denied. \"There's a set of criteria that we've been using to make the decisions,\" Twyford said. \"The people have to have some skill or expertise or talent that is critical to their project that can't be met by someone in New Zealand... It has to be time critical... And the third thing is that it has to have significant economic value, some wider benefit to the economy, to supply chains, employment, rather than just being a problem for that particular industry.\" Cameron is concurrently working on four planned sequels to 2009's <em>Avatar</em>.

It's the same concept but a young cast. The one for theatrical would be the same cast.\"<br/> He said the film is currently being written and the series has a pilot script written with an outline for future episodes. At this stage in the process though, it's always important to know it's not a done deal. Just because these projects are in development and being written doesn't mean they'll necessarily get made. But, will Disney turn down a four-quadrant name-brand franchise from Bruckheimer and Cage? Or another piece of original content for its streaming service with name recognition? Probably not. There are no guarantees, though. Either way, for fans of the franchise, and there are plenty out there, this is exciting news. To recap, <em>National Treasure </em>was a film released in 2004 about Nicolas Cage stealing the Declaration of Independence. Think of it as the Disney version of <em>Tomb Raider </em>meets<em> Ocean's Eleven </em>with a history lesson attached. That film was a big enough hit to spawn a 2007 sequel, <em>Book of Secrets,</em> in which Cage's character\u2013whose name is Benjamin Franklin Gates\u2013has to kidnap the president.

Based on Greg Rucka and Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez's <a href=\"https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/the-old-guard\" >Image comic</a>, <em>The Old Guard</em> is being brought to life on Netflix by Gina Prince-Bythewood and Rucka (who wrote the screenplay). The titular Old Guard is led by Andromache of Scythia (Charlize Theron), who's hardest hit (emotionally speaking) by the war she and her fellow immortals have spent countless lives fighting. Just as Andy begins to sink into the depths of an existential malaise and starts to question the point of it all, she comes to learn of a newly \"activated\" immortal, something that surprises her and her team because it's the first time in millennia since another joined their ranks. In a new interview with <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/05/first-look-at-charlize-theron-immortal-warrior-in-the-old-guard\" >Vanity Fair</a>, Theron went into detail about where Andy's at mentally and how discovering Nile Freeman (Kiki Layne, <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>) changes both of the warriors' lives. \"The worst part for her is just feeling like she's not doing anything. So what is the point, you know? She's lost faith, not just in herself but in humanity. I think a lot of people can relate to that at this moment in time,\" Theron said adding, \"From the first moment I read Rucka's graphic novel, I felt like there was great potential to make this thing feel really very relevant and have it ask some real questions about humanity. Is what we're doing enough? Is what we're doing actually changing anything? Are we making [things] better, or are we making the world worse?\" When Nile, once a Marine, first reincarnates after being killed during a mission, her confusion at what's happened to her is only eclipsed by the reality that she has to grieve everything she's lost in <em>secret , </em>because if anyone were to ever figure out what she and the other immortals could do, they'd\u2013of course\u2013be hunted down and thrown into a lab to be studied. Initially, Nile and Andy's relationship is a rocky one, but director Prince-Bythewood explained that, in time, the two women come to see one another as sisters who just might be exactly who they need to help work through their respective traumas. \"I love the thought of taking that veteran/rookie conceit and putting it in this,\" said Prince-Bythewood. \"The moment that Andy wants it all over and done with is when a new immortal shows up. Their relationship is the emotional core throughout the film.\" Of course, this being an action movie, it's only a matter of time before the immortals <em>are </em>discovered by a historian working for the CIA (<em>Doctor Strange</em>'s Chiwetel Ejiofor) and a pharmatech bro (<a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/has-anyone-seen-a-bear-1839861096\">Harry Melling</a> of <em>Harry Potter </em>fame) who see the group as a moneymaking opportunity. The pair of villains think they might have a shot at taking the team down and locking them away, but the immortals haven't made it this far without learning how to wreck anybody foolish enough to get in their way. Just how close to the original comic <em>The Old Guard</em>'s going to skew is one of the more interesting questions yet to be seen about the movie.

While so much of <em>Hercules </em>cleaved to the demigod's narrative roots, the Muses stood out because of how well their framing as an all-knowing girl group fit into their traditional characterization as the embodiments of the arts. More than that, though, each of the Muses\u2013Calliope (Lillias White), Clio (Vaneese Y. Thomas), Melpomene (Cheryl Freeman), Terpsichore (LaChanze), and Thalia (Roz Ryan)\u2013were depicted as and voiced by Black women whose collective talents turned gospel bangers into the soundtrack of fictional antiquity. The Muses' larger significance was something that might have been lost on non-Black theatergoers who don't quite understand what it meant to see and hear elements of Black culture and Black people put front and center in a way that was intentionally reverential and not at all disparaging. To put it quite simply: Characters like the Muses simply didn't exist in Disney's movies before <em>Hercules. </em>Though the studio had produced a number of other productions revolving around characters of color, they were almost always the focal points of stories that, on some level, felt like Disney attempting to make up for the fact that it spent decades pouring the vast majority of its energies into stories about white characters. The Muses were some of Disney's first characters who all read as an explicit celebration of Blackness without being sandboxed into Disney's Black Movie Mold\u2122, which makes them an important part of the larger animation landscape. It's also precisely why the Muses in the live-action <em>Hercules </em>should also be portrayed by Black women. Disney's changed a number of details in the live-action remakes that it's put out recently (<a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/so-will-smith-doesnt-exactly-sing-in-aladdin-but-it-1833792850\">Will Smith's beatboxing Genie</a> and <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/emma-watson-reveals-why-the-villagers-are-the-real-mons-1792439789\">Emma Watson's engineering-minded Belle</a> come to mind), and they've mostly worked because those characters were essentially presented as blank-ish slates in their original incarnations.

So how does he keep the challenge of being a superhero any fun for himself between his training and everyday life in a world where every fight can end in an instance?

Lionsgate shared a few more details about the production (other returnees from previous films will include producer Nina Jacobson and screenwriter Michael Arndt; Collins herself will write the screenplay treatment), and the plot: The film will focus on Coriolanus Snow at age 18, years before he would become the tyrannical President of Panem. Young Coriolanus is handsome and charming, and though the Snow family has fallen on hard times, he sees a chance for a change in his fortunes when he is chosen to be a mentor for the Tenth Hunger Games\u2026 only to have his elation dashed when he is assigned to mentor the girl tribute from impoverished District 12.

Because everyone's <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/10-sci-fi-and-fantasy-podcasts-that-will-give-your-ears-1842792838\">spending more time inside</a>, Disney's diligently added more and more classic films like <em>Splash </em>to the <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/10-cult-favorite-or-should-be-cult-favorite-movies-lu-1839898463\">Disney+ catalog</a>.

We've reached out to Disney to see <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-han-shot-first-scene-from-star-wars-has-been-change-1839802913\">when and why the edits were made</a> and will update should we hear back.

The two of them kiss before she prances back into the ocean, as mermaids with legs are wont to do. In the original cut of the movie, you can clearly see Hannah's butt because, well, she's a mermaid and has no concept of the need to wear human clothing, but in Disney+'s edited version, her butt's been edited out... Rather than simply cutting around the shot, Disney instead <em>tried </em>to elongate Hannah's hair so as to cover her exposed butt. But for whatever reason, the post-production house didn't try to make the hair look real, appropriate, or as if it was actually a part of the movie. What's currently streaming makes it look as if hair's just straight up growing out of the mermaid's rear, which is made that much more ridiculous by the fact that\u2013according to Gizmodo's Alex Cranz, a noted terror\u2013you can still see Hannah's nipples in a number of shots. Right here seems just the place to mention that the Hulk's entire, well-sculpted green ass (including the cleft) is still available to view in <em>Thor: Ragnarok </em>on Disney+.

Last we heard from Miller, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/george-miller-says-hes-still-making-another-mad-max-mov-1840287678\">he was pretty confident</a> that a movie based on Charlize Theron's character would happen, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/updates-on-dune-the-game-of-thrones-prequel-and-more-1836360249?_ga=2.189223464.2058015170.1584977341-1982811367.1584376436\">but nothing was set in stone</a>. If he's meeting actors though and has a potential window to start filming, it seems likely things have progressed well beyond that. And Anya Taylor-Joy, who broke out in <em>The Witch</em> and has since starred in <em>Split, </em><a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/io9-roundtable-the-beautiful-and-terrifying-the-dark-c-1837850236\"><em>Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</em></a>, and the upcoming (<a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/disney-is-delaying-mulan-antlers-and-new-mutants-1842300278\">maybe</a>) <em>New Mutants</em>, would be a worthy addition to any cast. io9 reached out to Warner Bros. for comment and or clarification on this but had not heard back as of publication. We'll update this post if/when that happens. Of course, it's also important to remember that even if Miller is meeting actors for the project and thinks he may film next year, there's no guarantee that happens or that timeline works out.

According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/china-rerelease-old-blockbusters-help-cinemas-reopen-1285348\" >the Hollywood Reporter</a>, China's movie industry is starting to reignite after facing over a <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/disneys-attempts-to-avoid-the-errors-of-mulans-original-1841933231\">month of closures</a> due to the spread of the novel coronavirus. A few cinemas in remote areas of the country have started reopening, but so far they're not attracting people\u2013with only about $1,000 in nationwide ticket sales over the course of the week. China's Film Bureau and the state-backed studio China Film Group are working to give cinemas the go-ahead to screen some of the country's biggest blockbusters for free, letting them keep 100 percent of ticket revenue. Not only does it help struggling cinemas reopen their doors, but it also encourages them to adjust prices for attendees. Right now, the films on the docket are <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/netflix-stealth-dropped-chinese-sci-fi-blockbuster-the-1834565000\"><em>The Wandering Earth</em></a>, China's second highest-grossing film of all time, <em>Wolf Warrior 2, Wolf Totem</em>, and the Lebanese film <em>Capernaum</em>. But it's also bringing in support from Western studios. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/03/china-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone-release-cinemas-reopening-coronavirus-1202887361/\" >Deadline</a> reports that Warner Bros. is planning to screen a special 4K 3D re-release of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em>, a franchise that was wildly successful in China. No word when this will happen or whether it will be connected to the previously mentioned revenue plan. According to Deadline, we could also see other major titles like the <em>Avengers</em> series, <em>Interstellar</em>, and <em>Inception</em> return to China in re-releases\u2013in addition to films that have already been cleared by censors, like <em>Dolittle, Jojo Rabbit, </em>and<em> Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, that had their originally planned debuts scrapped by theater closures. Hollywood has been making major adjustments in the wake of covid-19. Several movies that were scheduled to arrive in theaters in the coming months have been delayed.

The audio commentary from Hooper is relatively dull in tone but full of strange, sometimes pompous justifications for <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/in-an-unprecedented-move-universal-is-sending-theaters-1840595453\">the movie's choices</a>\u2013which is kind of fascinating, considering it was recorded <em>after</em> the New York premiere on December 13, when first reactions to this otherworldly experience had already started surfacing. Do we recommend watching <em>Cats</em> with the director commentary? Hmm, not unless you're a diehard <em>Cats</em> fan eager for any taste of that delicious milkbar juice (which I most certainly am). To save you two hours of hearing Hooper explain over and over why cats are cats but also not cats, we've pulled out 20 highlights from the director commentary for you to enjoy. All the quotes in the list are from Tom Hooper himself. \"<em>Macavity!\" (poof)</em> 1. What is <em>Cats </em>really about?: \"The film sits in that tradition of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque_novel\" >picaresque</a> or sort of medieval morality play, where the hero goes on a physical journey where they meet characters who represent different virtues and vices, and through this learn about their place in the world and learn about some of the pitfalls and opportunities of the world.\"<br/> 2.<strong> </strong>The film opens on a shot of the moon, and an image of a cat's face soon appears in the clouds. Hooper explained the reason for this shot: \"I thought we'd start on the image of the moon, which in [T.S.] Eliot's poetry\u2013specifically in the <em>Practical Cats</em>\u2013the moon is referenced as a source of sort of spiritual and magical power...I like the idea that the moon lights up this cat face in the clouds, which hints at the idea of the <a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/cats-got-one-thing-right-1840659051\">Heaviside Layer</a>, this layer in the atmosphere where you could go to get renewed and reborn. And also, I think it sort of sets the tone for the film, by I think referencing back to that thing you do as a kid when you look at clouds, and your mum points out the shape of an animal, and the idea of hidden identities sitting within things.\" 3. The movie takes place in the 1930s\u2013specifically playing homage to 1939, as that's when Eliot wrote the original <em>Cats</em> poem. The main location, the Egyptian Theater, was so named because Egyptians worshipped cats. Also, if you look in the theater's windows you'll see cat eyes staring back at you. 4. During the scene inside a cemetery, Munkustrap explains to Victoria (the audience surrogate) why cats have three names. Hooper went into the symbolism behind a Jellicle Cat's third name: \"<em>The Naming of Cats</em> is a brilliant poem by Eliot because it references this idea that there are kind of different levels of name. Not only the first name, which the humans use; the second name, which only the cats use; but the third secret name that even your fellow cat doesn't understand and can only be accessed by the cat through a sort of process of deep meditation, which of course is a reference to the sort of meditative pose or kind of lazy pose we see cats in...In this cat's poem, meditating on your secret hidden name that only you know gives you some kind of access to peace.\" 5. It was Rebel Wilson's idea to have the mice played by kids\u2013no explanation for why they were so much smaller than they should have been. 6. \"Women playing cockroaches\u2013whose only unusual trait is that they have an extra pair of arms, in homage to the cockroach number of limbs.\" (This isn't important but it made me laugh.) 7.<strong> </strong>Hooper explaining the digital fur:<strong> </strong>\"From the beginning, I always wanted humans to play cats\u2013partly because it's a dance musical, so I wanted to capture live dance. But also if I was lucky enough to capture lightning in a bottle with a great performance I wanted to be able to be in full contact with that in the face. And it also felt like a way of honoring the tradition in the show of humans playing cats. I wanted to kind of create, I suppose, a covering of fur that was better than what a costume could do. But still be one-to-one with the real bodies, so that the way we captured the dance was utterly faithful to the way they did the dance, or in the case, Rebel's physical comedy.\" (Side note: He later mentioned how Shambleshanks wears pants so you could see the full movement of his tap dance, so I don't know what the hell he's talking about here.)<br/> 8.<strong> </strong>During the kitchen scene, Jennyanydots (Wilson) unzips her fur skin to reveal a sparkly outfit underneath...and another layer of fur. Hooper's explanation for what might be the movie's scariest choice: \"This gag is kind of my own tongue-in-cheek way of referencing that I'm using digital fur as clothing because Rebel actually unzips her digital fur to reveal it as clothing. But then the joke is that underneath she has more real fur, which of course is not real fur.\" 9. Turns out, Bustopher Jones (James Corden) has a dark side: <strong> </strong>\"He clearly represents the idea of the sin of gluttony, or the perils of addiction\u2013of giving into that kind of drive without any kind of check or moderation...Seeing Macavity, seeing this incredible new source of food; there's almost a tinge of sadness or tinge of worry in him, as he's drawn to the very thing that he kind of knows will destroy him. I suppose it's a parable about the power of addiction, the dark power of addiction.\" 10. Hooper said the moment he laughed the most during filming was during the alley scene, when Corden looked at the camera to say \"cats\" (that said, either Corden messed it up or they didn't end up using that angle, because in the movie he's actually looking slightly off-camera and it's weird): \"I loved the way James had this idea of looking to camera when he said \u2018cats' [during the alley scene], as if to kind of acknowledge the fact that they really look enough like cats, or do they not. And I love the idea that James is sort of stepping out of the film for a moment to acknowledge the kind of natural tension between their claim that they were cats and the kind of hybrid design.\" 11. That song on the barge, where Growltiger introduces himself through song to Bustopher Jones and Jennyanydots, could have been<em> so much </em>longer: \"There's this sort of longer version of this that we shot with, I think, three verses, and between every verse James and Rebel interrupted Ray and improvised hilarious comedy. And so the scene started three times as long, but in the end, we had to kind of find its right balance within the shape of the film. But shooting those it was kind of extraordinary the humor that James and Rebel were able to improvise. It was great acting, I really loved working on those scenes.\" 12. On casting <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/it-doesnt-count-if-your-character-comes-out-in-a-junket-1840632727?_ga=2.44297252.1289560509.1584365838-1751557175.1567029747\">Judy Dench</a> as Old Deuteronomy: \"Why does the god of cats have to be a man?\"<br/> 13. It was apparently Dench and Ian McKellen who decided their cats had boned in the past, and the world is all the more thankful for it. 14. Hooper explaining the big Jellicle Dance scene, where the cats gather in the Egyptian Theater and dance around a bunch before the auditions to determine who is the Jellicle Choice: \"It becomes about a different way of accessing the spiritual high or a spiritual place. In the naming of cats in the graveyard earlier, it was suggested you could reach it through the contemplation of your hidden name. And here, you're arriving at a spiritual state through the kinesis and the catharsis of a sort of tribalistic, atavistic dance. So it kind of taps into the deepest traditions of how dance has existed in our culture, where the movement and the intensity transports you and takes you to a different space. Showing these different strategies of touching the spiritual: From the name to the Jellicle Dance, to the end where the character of Grizabella is literally lifted into the spiritual plane.\" (That's right, Grizabella totally died.) 15. The Shimbleshanks train sequence was one of Hooper's favorites and Hooper said Steven McRae had no singing experience so he spent months learning to sing the part live. In addition, the actor who played Mr. Mistoffelees (Laurie Davidson) had no dance training, so he took daily barre classes for months during rehearsals and filming. Clearly the actors put in way more effort than the movie deserved. 16. Hooper shared some details on casting Idris Elba as Macavity and why he wanted Macavity\u2013naked as a jaybird cat\u2013to jump in at the end and participate in Bombalina's (Taylor Swift) song about him: \"I met Idris at the Electric [Cinema] in Notting Hill to talk about the role, and turned out he always wanted to do a musical and it seemed like a great chance to do his first musical...I always liked the idea that Macavity, despite being an evil genius, kind of wants to play by the rules, so he wants to put on a number that is better than everyone else's and win by doing something brilliant, but also by having kidnapped all the other competition.\"<br/> 17. \"I liked the idea that magic is more likely to be successful if he sort of uses Judy's cat basket to help the magic.\" (Again, this just made me laugh a bunch.) 18. On filming \"Memory\" (in my opinion, the only good sequence.):<strong> </strong><br/>\"We shot this over one day, I think it was about 15 takes and this is mainly take 15 with a bit of take 14. I can't imagine what it would be like to be Jennifer Hudson with the pressure of singing the most iconic song from the musical...Like with <em>Les Mis</em>, not only is the singing live, but the accompaniment is live, so it's really a duet between the pianist and the performer.\" \"This was one of the most memorable days to me, because Jennifer really got to a very raw place, and I think everybody was floored by it. But I think the most exciting thing was when she hits her belt voice on \u2018touch me.' Even though I was sitting behind the set watching the monitors, every time it got to that point I'd take my headphones because I wanted to hear it for real in the room, and my gosh what a sound.\" 19. One of the most baffling moments of the film, the one that usually gets the most screams from the audience, is near the end when Old Deuteronomy suddenly looks straight into the camera to tell the audience a bunch of things about cats (like how they're not dogs). Here's Hooper's reason for doing it:<strong> </strong> \"From early on, I loved this idea that in a show where most of the songs are addressed to the audience, the surprise would be that Judy Dench as Old Deuteronomy would turn to camera and address the audience directly because this is the one poem where it has to be addressed to a human. Most of the other songs were re-thought where the person being addressed was Victoria, so the listener was not a human but a cat. I love the line \u2018You've learned enough to take the view that cats are very much like you,' again as an explanation why our cats are kind of human cats. I suppose we're talking about the intersection of cat and human.\" 20. And finally, this is just a delight: \"I love this idea that \u2018This is how you address a cat.' I must admit I've actually tried this, tried bowing down to a cat and saying \u2018Oh cat' just in the slight hope that this might unleash the cat to talk to me. It hasn't yet worked, but I will continue trying.\" <em>Cats</em> is currently available on digital and arrives on DVD and Blu-ray on April 7.", "entities": ["Les Mis", "Macavity!xe2x80x9d poof", "The Naming of Cats", "Practical Cats"]}, "https://io9.gizmodo.com/jumanji-director-jake-kasdan-on-how-next-level-continue-1842383658": {"title": "Jumanji Director Jake Kasdan on How Next Level Continued to Pay Homage to the Original", "content": "The <em>Jumanji</em> franchise is both surprisingly simple and subtly unique.

However, those two films also serve as <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/dwayne-johnson-promises-the-new-jumanji-will-honor-robi-1775627522\">subtle sequels to the 1995 <em>Jumanji</em> film</a> that, besides the title, seems completely unrelated.

In the 1995 Robin Williams-starring movie, it was a board game that expands into the real world. In both <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-charismatic-cast-of-jumanji-elevates-an-otherwise-t-1821125780?_ga=2.108564612.741673420.1584305898-1215098148.1584305897\">2017's <em>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</em></a> and 2019's <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em>, it's a video game that brings the real world inside of Jumanji. And though there was no mandate to tie them all together, <em>Welcome to the Jungle </em>and<em> Next Level</em> director Jake Kasdan felt it was only right. \"I felt like we were separate enough that people, once they saw it, would not feel like we were actually treading on something that they love in a way that offends them, which is something that you have to be conscious of,\" Kasdan told io9 on the phone last week. \"So knowing what I knew, which is that actually our concept is probably sufficiently different to where that wouldn't be a problem, I liked the idea of paying our respects to the first movie and saying that that world is still alive in our continuation, even though we're telling a different story.\" In <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em>, those respects are paid when the players realize Alan Parrish (the name of <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-did-robin-williams-discover-multiple-jumanji-worlds-1819404588?_ga=2.45596066.741673420.1584305898-1215098148.1584305897\">Williams' character</a> in the first movie) had previously been stuck in the same game world\u2013Jumanji\u2013before them. In <em>The Next Level,</em> it comes with the introduction of a restaurant called \"Nora's.\" Nora is the aunt of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce), the young characters who discover and play <em>Jumanji</em> in the original movie. Bebe Neuwirth played the aunt in 1995 and reprises it in <em>The Next Level</em> as the restaurant's owner. \"The original <em>Jumanji</em> has its own story and it's exactly right the way it is,\" Kasdan said. \"I don't really feel comfortable continuing that story exactly [but] this was a good way to include the world, include a character that I love and who was played by an actor that I love, and it would be a way that she could step into our stories that would be completely organic to both the original movie and to our movie.\"<br/> Much in the way <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em> is a somewhat surprising sequel to the original <em>Jumanji</em>, Kasdan told us he was originally <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/of-course-were-getting-a-jumanji-sequel-1822767224?_ga=2.108564612.741673420.1584305898-1215098148.1584305897\">kind of surprised to be doing a sequel to his movie too</a>. Though <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em> was one of the biggest box office hits of 2017, he wasn't immediately sure what, or if, he wanted to do as a follow-up. \"We were only going to do a sequel if we could come up with something that we were really excited about,\" Kasdan said. \"And so there was <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/jumanjis-first-trailer-is-here-and-no-one-is-happy-to-b-1796511923?_ga=2.10532018.741673420.1584305898-1215098148.1584305897\">this initial phase</a> of like \u2018It would be great, but let's be tough on it. We'll have all the conversations and kick it around and see if we can figure it out.' And then an idea that I loved came pretty quickly.\"<br/> That idea was adding a whole new generation to the story in the characters of Eddie (Danny DeVito) and Milo (Danny Glover), two older men who were formerly best friends but haven't talked in years. They, along with the teens from <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em>, get sucked into Jumanji in <em>The Next Level</em>. \"Doing another one of these adventures, but from the point of view of these two guys, you're just coming at it from a completely different moment in their lives,\" Kasdan said. Adding Milo and Eddie gave the director the chance to get <em>Jumanji's</em> two biggest stars, Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, to do funny impressions of well-known older actors, but more importantly, their friendship gave the film all sorts of new themes regarding friendship, aging, and mortality. Whether not those characters will continue on in a sequel, we don't know. But the end of <em>The Last Level</em> does hint at what could happen next in the franchise. Kasdan admits the mid-credit scene, of a flock of ostriches from earlier in the movie now running around the real world, was done very purposefully.<br/> \"It's not random and it felt like the appropriate expansion of that story. Like the movie you would want to see. Or that <em>I</em> would want to see. Or a <em>part of</em> the movie that I would want to see,\" Kasdan said. \"It feels something you'd want to see. But we certainly didn't have the whole thing figured out.

But when you watch the accompanying <em>K-12 </em>film and visually drink in the story Martinez has created, it becomes a much more powerful <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-team-behind-gothams-new-fairy-tale-anthology-tells-1841582691\">fairytale</a> about the lives we lead long after leaving <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/that-alien-high-school-play-got-to-put-on-an-encore-per-1834354893\">school</a>.<br/> <em>K-12</em>\u2013a series of 13 videos written and directed by Martinez\u2013re-introduces you to Crybaby, the eponymous hero from Martinez's debut album, a girl living in a reality that feels like a warped blend between <em>But I'm a Cheerleader </em>and <em>Booksmart </em>with the essence of <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-crafts-rachel-true-rightfully-calls-out-conventions-1832265645\"><em>The Craft</em></a><em> </em>woven throughout. Because Crybaby's absentee mother struggles with substance abuse, she's there's no one to see her off as she leaves the house to catch the bus to the K-12 Sleepaway School\u2013a twisted, and supernatural academy where students are taught to adhere to strict, gendered roles. Like some of K-12's other pupils, Crybaby possesses a number of magical talents that tend to manifest in moments when she's stressed. But because she and her good friend Angelita are the only people who seem willing to purposefully use their powers, their peers ostracize them and do everything they can to make the girls feel as if they're don't belong. Individually, each of <em>K-12</em>'s 13 musical scenes works to accompany the album's tracks, but they're strung together to create one cohesive narrative illustrating how people's earliest emotional and physical traumas can become baggage they go on to carry years after the inciting incident. \"Wheels on the Bus\" establishes what everyday life is like for Crybaby and she and Angelita are bullied in clear sight of the bus driver, but it also emphasizes that as bad as the teasing itself is, the fact that the bus driver is both aware of what's going on and more concerned with ogling the girls' bodies reflects a much larger danger facing them. What's interesting about <em>K-12</em>'s ideas about power is how its younger characters' dynamics drastically shift as they arrive at their school and begin interacting with teachers and other authority figures. The issues Crybaby has with the group of popular mean girls don't disappear once they settle into their class, but they're superseded by more complicated problems like the ways that K-12's faculty beat students or send them off to be drugged and mentally reprogrammed. The nature of Crybaby's magic is never really explained, but it feels very much like an organic part of <em>K-12</em>'s world, in large part because of the dreamlike way that things are presented. When Crybaby's caught levitating and using her pigtails to choke a bully who threatened to kill her, both girls are dragged to the principal's office where Crybaby's able to clairvoyantly witness a meeting in which the principal humiliates and fires Ms. Harper, a teacher in the process of transitioning. By going a step further and pushing her consciousness into the principal's mind, Crybaby's able to make her case to him (in front of a jury of wigged men) that he's actively hurting the people he's meant to support with the power he's been given. Throughout the film, Crybaby makes a number of attempts to implore those around her that they don't <em>have </em>to live in constant fear and pain if only they'd choose not to participate in the system as it's established. While most people rebuff her efforts, they're not for nothing, because gradually Crybaby comes across others who can use their magic at will and understand that the change she wants to fight for can become a reality Just as <em>K-12 </em>begins to feel as if its story is coming together into more of a straight line, it takes a few moments to slow down and remind you of how difficult a task tearing down an institutional system truly is. For all of the allies that Crybaby makes along the way, the more she moves toward her goal, the more fraught and complicated things become, and at times, her own resolve wavers. As you fall deeper and deeper into <em>K-12</em>'s psychedelic rabbit hole, the film increasingly shifts into an <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>-esque nightmare space, but the ending it builds to is something far more fascinating than Crybaby simply waking up and realizing it was all a dream. Rather, <em>K-12 </em>lands on the idea that fighting to free one's self is both a worthwhile endeavor and a process that might not end exactly when you believe it will.

The siblings, who have an unusually close relationship that speaks to their <em>not quite human</em> origins, spend most of the movie as fugitives, but fortunately their extraordinary abilities\u2013including Tia's handy ability to talk to animals\u2013help keep them safe until they track down the rest of their long-lost family. <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/e-t-and-the-real-grown-up-elliott-reunite-in-a-commer-1840072382\">Middle kid Elliott</a> (Henry Thomas) first discovers the skittish alien that's taken up residence in his family's backyard shed, and he's the one who really bonds with the creature.

Barring the fact that <em>Fantastic Beasts </em>is a prequel and would need to go to extreme lengths to justify his inclusion, Radcliffe responded that it's not something that he wants to do at this time. Not only because he thinks the franchise is doing fine without him and his <em>Harry Potter</em> co-stars, but also because he doesn't want to sign onto another franchise that requires several film projects. This could explain why <em>Moon Knight</em> <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/sorry-but-daniel-radcliffe-is-not-your-moon-knight-1841858416\">isn't happening</a>, as well as why J.K.

I feel like those films have moved on and they're doing just fine without us. I'm happy to keep it that way. I like what my life is now,\" he said. \"I'm not saying that I'll never go back into any franchise, but I like the flexibility that I have with my career now. And I don't want to get into a situation where I'm signed up for one series for years in advance.\" Out of his main co-stars, Radcliffe has had the most unconventional post-<em>Harry Potter</em> career. Instead of coasting on sweet early retirement money, he's taken on projects that run the gamut of curiosities\u2013from playing a bloated corpse in<em> Swiss Army Man </em>to an angelic assistant in<em> Miracle Workers</em>, even Igor in <em>Victor Frankenstein</em>. He's gained a reputation for taking on anything that's \"<a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/all-hail-daniel-radcliffes-6-weirdest-post-harry-potter-1841185323\">weird</a>,\" but Radcliffe doesn't totally agree with that assessment. He told Variety that people tend to identify him so much with his bespectacled counterpart (not surprising, considering many grew up watching him as Harry) that it makes it strange for them to see him in more unconventional roles. \"I accept the label in that there's nothing I've shied away from, but I wasn't like, \u2018find me the weirdest thing out there.'

It's a bigass sword, and that's fun. Although honestly, it could afford to be bigger?

It's <em>also</em> fun that honestly, Jaa's outfit is a pretty accurate take on <em>World</em>'s Field Team Leader, so even if the movie itself seems pretty out of wack in terms of its story, at least aesthetically it's pretty spot on so far. Jovovich is playing a soldier named Natalie Artemis, who, alongside her unit, finds themselves teleported to a mysterious world inspired by the <em>Monster Hunter </em>games, and must team up with Jaa's Hunter to learn the ways of monster huntin' and find their way home.

Since the spread of the novel coronavirus\u2013which causes a pneumonia-like illness officially designated COVID-19\u2013beginning late last year, the Chinese government's <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/global-death-toll-from-covid-19-surpasses-2-000-though-1841778240\">ongoing crackdowns</a> to quarantine the disease within its borders have included major restrictions on the country's box office industry. Since late January, every movie theater in China\u2013over 70,000 in total\u2013has been shut down in an attempt to discourage people from leaving their homes, leading to the cancellation of several Western releases in the last month, including Disney-adjacent titles like Fox Searchlight's <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/jojo-rabbit-is-taika-waititis-most-emotional-film-to-da-1838271960\"><em>Jojo Rabbit</em></a>. As the situation around COVID-19 develops, not just in China but in outbreaks across the world, there's uncertainty over whether or not <em>Mulan</em>'s Chinese debut will have to be scrapped. Not releasing day-and-date in China could deliver a huge blow to Disney's hopes for the film, itself a radical re-invention of the animated movie that has been tweaked to try and cater the Chinese audience\u2013<a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/new-footage-from-mulan-was-filled-with-a-whirlwind-of-e-1837542561?_ga=2.47375151.904714694.1582488711-105069102.1526253072\">retaining more elements</a> from the classic Chinese epic ballad, and removing elements from the animated version, such as its original songs and characters like Mushu the dragon. The current situation has shades of the controversy surrounding the original <em>Mulan</em>'s release. As THR notes, after facing lingering backlash within the country for Disney's release of Martin Scorsese's <em>Kundun\u2013</em>the 1997 biopic about the Dalai Lama and the Chinese occupation of Tibet\u2013the Chinese government stalled the debut of <em>Mulan</em> for nearly a year after its Western debut. Releasing in early 1999 after families had returned to work following the New Year holidays (and pirated copies were easily accessible), <em>Mulan</em> was an unmitigated <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/299618.stm\" >box office bomb</a>. Now, hopes that this latest version could turn the tables are looking increasingly unlikely. It means that <em>Mulan</em>'s performance in the U.S. is now more important than ever for the House of Mouse. The film has already had to deal with concerns from fans that the live-action remake <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/any-live-action-mulan-without-ill-make-a-man-out-of-you-1793404876\">removes too much</a> from the animated original, as well as controversies around its star, Liu Yifei, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/hong-kong-protesters-urge-boycott-of-disneys-mulan-rema-1837333438\">who sparked backlash</a> last summer when she posted messages of support for the Hong Kong police on Weibo at the height of protests in the country about Chinese rule of the island, leading to calls for international boycotts of the film. \"I think it's obviously a very complicated situation and I'm not an expert,\" was all Liu would tell THR about the backlash to her comments. \"I just really hope this gets resolved soon, I think it's just a very sensitive situation.\" We won't have much longer to see just how <em>Mulan</em> does in the West, where its March 27 rollout is still well on track.

With this rating, <em>Mulan</em> joins a rare group of Walt Disney films that have received the PG-13 rating, which was introduced in 1984. Starting in 2003 with <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</em>, Disney's only had 10 movies in its direct repertoire be rated higher than PG\u2013half of then coming from the <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/disney-is-reportedly-looking-to-reboot-pirates-of-the-c-1829948993\"><em>Pirates of the Caribbean </em>franchise</a>. And they've still never made a PG-13 animated film. These don't include movies produced through Touchstone, 20th Century Studios, or any of the Marvel or <em>Star Wars</em> films. It's no surprise Disney's avoided the \"13\" part of the ranking, as it can be a risky venture for the studio. Sure, the <em>Pirates</em> movies have been smash hits and <em>Saving Mr. Banks</em> was a success, but every other one of Disney's journeys into PG-13 territory have been failures. These include<em> </em><a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/lone-ranger-is-johnny-depps-tribute-to-shitty-superher-654517516\"><em>The Lone Ranger</em></a>, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/john-carter-will-dazzle-you-with-the-best-and-worst-o-5891825\"><em>John Carter</em></a>, and the ill-fated attempt to turn <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/john-olivers-attack-on-hollywood-whitewashing-is-both-s-1760630299\"><em>Prince of Persia</em></a> into the next <em>Pirates</em>-esque franchise. <em>Mulan</em> will be a gamble, but perhaps one that'll work in their favor.

The film's original ending <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/who-put-this-dragon-in-the-new-dolittle-trailer-1840794361\">also featured a dragon</a>, but nothing to do with its butt. However, the studio didn't think that version of the movie was any good, so it kept bringing people in to switch it up. Later, during a reshoot, Downey himself changed what was the original plan. \"Several sources say it was the actor-producer who came up with the idea of the dragon colonoscopy/enema moment at the last minute,\" the report says. Predictably, Downey's camp didn't want to comment on the allegation. But wait, there's more! Even when it was decided Dolittle would clean a dragon's colon with his hands, one cut of the movie reportedly had him remove \"a boulder-sized stool\" from the dragon. In the final film though, the fecal matter was replaced with inanimate objects. Is it just us or do you feel like we deserve a supercut of all the different endings of the movie, from the original lack of butt stuff to the much grosser butt stuff to the boring (at least, by comparison) butt stuff that ended up in the movie?

That film cost $30 million and Reubens is reportedly only looking for half that to make \"the dark Pee-wee movie,\" as he calls it. Part of that money would go to him, of course, and part of it would go to de-aging digital technology so he could make Pee-wee look the way Reubens wants, which is much younger than he actually is. He's reportedly shopping the film around Hollywood, and though Netflix and Apatow passed, he was in touch with the Safdie brothers, who recently made<em> Uncut Gems</em> with Adam Sander. Plus, the Hollywood Reporter says a Pee-wee superfan from the United Kingdom may even be interested in investing $10 million. But that's still not enough. \"I do feel like it's going to probably happen,\" he said. \"I have a couple of people that are interested. But this is Hollywood. A couple people interested and five bucks will get you five bucks.\" You'd like to say the idea of a dark Pee-wee movie is ill-conceived, but what if in the early 1980s, someone told you they wanted to dress up in a grey suit with a red bowtie and talk with a high pitched voice to a chair that talks back? That might sound like a bad idea too, but it worked out just fine.

He's done rom-coms, action flicks, and regular ol' dramas, but he's also quite clearly committed to <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/daniel-radcliffe-heads-way-back-in-time-for-anthology-c-1839965538\">keeping it weird</a> whenever possible. Here are six examples\u2013the good, the bad, and the WTF.<br/> The production design is nice, and it's always cool to see Andrew Scott <em>(Sherlock, Fleabag) </em>no matter the circumstances. But otherwise, Radcliffe is the very best part of Paul McGuigan's shrug-worthy, needlessly flashy attempt at reinterpreting Mary Shelley's horror classic, with an end result that still feels disappointingly conventional. James McAvoy plays a young version of the title character (screenwriter Max Landis makes sure we get the wink by including a Frankenstein/Frank-en-<em>steen</em> joke) who impulsively rescues Radcliffe's nameless hunchback from his hellish circus life. Just a few minutes later and Frankenstein has cured the pitiful lad of his hunchback-ness, given him a familiar name (Igor), sized up his hidden genius, and anointed him as <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/vic-and-igor-are-the-original-science-bros-in-the-first-1724788314\">his new lab partner</a>. Things begin to splinter when Igor's pesky conscience gets in the way of Victor's dicey experiments, though the not-yet-<em>totally</em>-mad scientist does get to bring his monster (briefly) to life before the finale. The movie ends with Victor penning a sappy letter to Igor about how Igor is his greatest creation, which feels a bit presumptuous, but at least we'll never get a sequel exploring this friendship's later years. Does this count as genre? Close enough, with the added meta-delight of famed magic poster boy Radcliffe appearing as a villainous tech genius who <em>sneers</em> at magic, even as he forces the <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-director-of-now-you-see-me-2-describes-the-magic-be-1781612616\">world's most notorious all-magician heist team to do his bidding</a>. The <em>Now You See Me </em>movies, which have suspiciously great casts (besides Radcliffe, the Jon M. Chu-directed sequel stars Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Lizzy Caplan, and Woody Harrelson times two, and that's not even everybody you'll recognize in the huge ensemble), are overstuffed and silly, but everyone involved seems to be well aware of that fact. That includes Radcliffe, who seems to be having the time of his life getting to play a baddie for once. Director Alexandre Aja <em>(High Tension, Crawl)</em> brings visual flair to this <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-first-locke-key-trailer-opens-the-door-to-a-haunt-1840854340\">Joe Hill</a> adaptation about a guy named Iggy who sprouts a pair of devil horns after the rape and murder of his childhood sweetheart, Merrin (Juno Temple). The horns are a painful inconvenience that shake up his dueling moods of paralyzing sadness and anger, both at the actual killer and at the fact that everyone in his community believes <em>he's</em> the killer. They also unlock a peculiar gift, which is that everyone Ig encounters\u2013nearly everyone in his town is <em>completely</em> toxic, by the way\u2013is compelled to overshare their darkest secrets and even give into their most forbidden and/or wildly inappropriate desires. Awkward! But also, it's actually a convenient development in a situation where Ig needs to suss out a murderer lurking in his midst and doesn't mind stirring up some chaos along the way. The whodunnit part of <em>Horns</em> <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/for-a-movie-about-peoples-dark-sides-horns-is-curiousl-1653145871\">is actually its weakest element</a>; early on, by process of elimination, it's pretty obvious who really killed Merrin (and even why they did it). But Radcliffe shows impressive range, enough to humanize a movie about a grieving man stuck in a living nightmare who's somehow also a literal devil creature, in a twist that's left unexplained, maybe for the best. Radcliffe's first post-<em>Potter</em> film was this 2012 take on Susan Hill's spooky novel, adapted by Jane Goldman (the <em>Kingsman</em> films) and directed by James Watkins <em>(Black Mirror). </em>It's a somber tale oozing with gothic atmosphere\u2013as is befitting its Hammer Film Productions stamp of approval\u2013and Radcliffe does most of the heavy lifting; a lot of the movie is just his character creeping around an old mansion that might as well have a neon sign affixed to its front door reading \"GHOSTS LIVE HERE.\" But <em>The Woman in Black</em> is more than just a cheap frightfest, mostly thanks to Radcliffe's performance. He plays a lawyer who's so deeply haunted by his wife's tragic demise that he's almost, maybe, <em>glad </em>he's been given a work assignment that offers irrefutable proof that life doesn't end with death. That said, the title character\u2013a vengeful mother whose anguish over losing her young son has turned her into a serial child killer from beyond the grave\u2013is effectively horrifying. To date, Radcliffe's biggest foray into genre TV (aside from guest-voice spots on shows like <em>Robot Chicken</em> and<em> BoJack Horseman</em>) is the <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/steve-buscemi-is-god-in-the-first-trailer-for-tbs-workp-1831218724\">TBS comedy <em>Miracle Workers</em></a>. In the first season of the anthology series, he plays Craig, whose gig at megacorp Heaven, Inc. consists of toiling in the dark, cluttered Department of Answered Prayers, helping people find their lost keys but passing on anything that feels too risky. When God (Steve Buscemi) decides he'd rather blow up Earth and get into the restaurant business instead, Craig and his cohorts scheme to save the planet by making someone's impossible wish come true; a love story sprouts in the human world as Craig works through his feelings for fellow Heaven employee Eliza (Geraldine Viswanathan). Season one of <em>Miracle Workers </em>highlighted Radcliffe's endless capacity for awkward charm\u2013see: the episode where Craig accidentally gets drunk on one of God's sludgy, umbrella-festooned \"shocktails\" and blurts out the whole anti-apocalypse plan\u2013and if you're a fan of <em>The Good Place</em>, it offers a different sort of take on <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-best-and-worst-afterlives-in-sci-fi-and-fantasy-1829668623\">an irreverent afterlife</a>. Season two, which premieres tonight, keeps the same actors but delivers a new setting and characters for <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/daniel-radcliffe-heads-way-back-in-time-for-anthology-c-1839965538\"><em>Miracle Workers: Dark Ages</em></a>, in which Radcliffe plays a hapless royal named \"Prince Chauncley.\" Yes, it's the farting corpse movie, but Radcliffe's Manny <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/movie-review-once-you-get-past-the-farting-swiss-army-1783123936\">actually does way more than fart</a> (though goddamn, does he fart a <em>lot</em>). On the lonely, hazy verge of suicide after being stranded on an island, Hank (Paul Dano) spots Manny wash ashore, and it doesn't take too long before the power of friendship brings Manny back to life, sorta, though he's extremely naive about everything (masturbation comes up a lot, but so do <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/what-does-the-farting-corpse-movie-swiss-army-man-have-1782748341\">the wonders of <em>Jurassic Park</em></a>) and his body has limited, albeit at-times nearly magical, functionality. Together, Hank and Manny struggle their way toward civilization, with some hints disputing exactly how \"stranded\" Hank really was, as well as how \"alive\" Manny really is\u2013though the latter ends up being more convincing. This proudly absurd, exceedingly quirky tale from Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert is something that must be seen to be believed, if only because it's impossible to convey how strangely poignant it ends up being. Has a more nuanced portrayal of a farting corpse ever been committed to film? It has not, and it likely never will be again. The numbers on the list end here, but Radcliffe shows no sign of easing up on his offbeat career choices. For instance, here's the trailer for <em>Guns Akimbo</em>, in which DanRad plays a guy <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-aquaman-movie-is-getting-an-animated-sequel-on-hb-1840958687\">with guns bolted to his hands</a>.

So, it's a really funny film,\" he said. \"Every scene has comedy in it. I'm excited for people to see more of the humor in the movie.\" In <em>Afterlife</em>, Wolfhard (best known for <em>Stranger Things </em>and<em> It</em>) plays Trevor, the son of Callie (Carrie Coon) and brother of Phoebe (McKenna Grace), who are probably all related to original <em>Ghostbusters</em> character Egon Spengler. Wolfhard's description of his character gives us a hint as to where some of that humor comes from. \"Yeah, he's a pretty dumb character,\" Wolfhard joked. <em>\"</em>It's not that he's written dumb, he's just a dumb teenager and totally naive. Everything is way over his head. He's obsessed with cars and girls. So, it's really fun to play him.\" With many trailers, TV spots, interviews, and more to come before the July release of <em>Afterlife</em>, eventually it's bound to become very clear what tone this movie is going to take, as well as more hints about its narrative. For now, though, we'll have to take Wolfhard's word that co-writer and director Jason Reitman really nails what makes <em>Ghostbusters</em> \"Ghostbusters.\" <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>, which also stars Paul Rudd <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/ewan-mcgregors-not-worried-about-the-obi-wan-kenobi-sho-1841097746\">and the returning</a> Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and Sigourney Weaver, opens July 10.", "entities": ["Ghostbusters: Afterlife", "Stranger Things"]}, "https://io9.gizmodo.com/disney-is-going-to-kill-bambi-s-mom-again-1841208297": {"title": "Disney Is Going to Kill Bambi\u2019s Mom Again", "content": "It's a new year but things are still the same when it comes to Disney's catalog of classic films.

That programming group? NBCUniversal. Back in 2016, Warner signed a major licensing deal with the network for exclusive broadcast and cable access to the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies and their spinoff siblings in the then-upcoming <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> franchise. The deal\u2013covering on-air and digital rights for not just the films, but featurettes, 3D re-releases, director's cuts, and other content associated with <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/j-k-rowling-tweets-support-for-researcher-dismissed-fo-1840533354?_ga=2.184249314.592373291.1579520410-105069102.1526253072\">J.K.

Because that's how we live now: Everyone has their <em>own</em> streaming app, because you paying one or two subscriptions a month to get access to many things is much more inconvenient for these studios' bottom line than you paying for what feels like a dozen instead, between the likes of AppleTV+, Peacock, Disney+, HBOMax, CBS All Access, and more. The announcement of Disney+ might have really kickstarted the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/why-disney-freaks-me-out-about-the-future-of-streaming-1834762436\">current, rapid transition</a> we've seen of large media brands getting into the streaming space with their own walled gardens, but it's sort of been the track the medium has been leaning toward in recent years. The convenience of being able to stream old favorites anywhere that spurred the meteoric rise of Netflix and its ilk has slowly but surely given way to original content and exclusivity deals\u2013look at, for example, yesterday's news that the Studio Ghibli film library will be available <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/netflix-just-picked-up-21-studio-ghibli-movies-but-not-1841103335\">globally on Netflix</a> starting February 1 everywhere but Japan and North America, the latter thanks to HBOMax's own exclusivity grab for the library, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/wow-studio-ghibli-movies-will-stream-on-the-upcoming-h-1839136145?_ga=2.189409007.592373291.1579520410-105069102.1526253072\">announced last October</a>.

If you have some time this weekend, it's well worth a read.

So now, still 3 months away from shooting (for me), my Gandalf doesn't exist, not even in my mind. He will only come to life as the camera turns and discoveries are made in the very moment. Even when I am in the thick of it, in costume and make-up and speaking Tolkien's words, I'm not sure I will be able to describe the character to you. Actors don't describe - they inhabit. The whole thing, separated into the Grey Book and the White Book, after Gandalf's transformations, is like this, with eloquent bits of actorly insight, as well as descriptions of the production process, from costuming to performing.

This back and forth has literally been happening for <em>over a decade.</em> One would think, with now four games to mine in the franchise, very well-defined characters, tone, and infinite potential storylines, making a movie wouldn't be that difficult. It's a modern Indiana Jones! Where could it go wrong? But obviously there's some kind of problem or here. Or, to put it in <em>Uncharted</em> terms, a curse. Whether it's directors who want to make a movie as epic as the games and the studio doesn't want to pay for it, or...well, that kind of has to be it, right? There could certainly be other reasons but money is obviously a factor. This is all hypothetical, of course, but you can easily imagine none of the scripts have been good enough for Sony to confidently invest a massive amount of money in. Or, conversely, perhaps there have been Sony-approved scripts that haven't been what the directors wanted to do. If everything was on point and ready to go, <em>Uncharted</em> would have happened well before Holland was cast, or at least in the past two years since he came on board. But it hasn't.

In the early to mid-1960s, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/roger-corman-talks-about-modern-technology-and-the-fema-1768989265\">director Roger Corman</a> and star Vincent Price churned out several films based on the works of <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/watch-edgar-allan-poes-greatest-stories-get-animated-in-1732883537\">Edgar Allan Poe</a>. <em>The Masque of the Red Death </em>is maybe the most scarring from a horror standpoint, especially since it concerns the spread of a hideous plague. The reliably great Price plays the cruel Prince Prospero; his name perfectly aligns with his lavish, Satan-blessed lifestyle, which is in stark contrast to the poor people who live in the village he lords over. When the dreaded disease appears, the prince shuts himself and a gaggle of nobles inside his castle for a debauched staycation, but you just can't stop the Red Death, who party-crashes just in time to make sure everyone who deserves it meets a gruesome fate. The story is set in medieval times, but the production design\u2013stuffed with luridly bright colors and trippy freak-outs\u2013is a psychedelic delight. <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/what-the-hell-is-a-giallo-movie-and-why-should-you-wat-1779988703\">Italian horror master Mario Bava</a> takes one of his sci-fi detours for this unsettling tale of space travelers who head to Aura, an uncharted planet, to answer a strange distress call\u2013years before <em>Alien</em>'s doomed crew would undertake a similarly ill-advised mission. The movie's title kind of gives the game away, but it turns out that Aura is home to supernatural beings who're capable of manipulating dead bodies (among their other talents). Seems they've been spending quite a bit of time trying to hitch a ride off Aura\u2013preferably to a more populated planet, full of fresh new bodies, with a landscape that isn't quite so riddled with the bones of their previous victims. \"Directed by Mario Bava\" <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/7-glamorously-gruesome-movies-that-combine-horror-and-h-1835590690\">means guaranteed eye candy</a>, and between the costumes (so many structured jumpsuits!), the artful lighting (primary colors galore), and the stylized set design (with a fog machine on overdrive), <em>Planet of the Vampires </em>does not disappoint. <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-10-best-and-2-most-baffling-hammer-horror-movies-1748428176\">Legendary gothic horror purveyors Hammer</a> produced multiple Frankenstein and Dracula films in the 1960s, but we're singling out macabre entry <em>The Plague of the Zombies </em>because it's a pre-<em>Night of the Living Dead</em> entry in a genre that continues to endure. Mystified by a series of deaths in his village, a doctor contacts his mentor for assistance; the older physician soon arrives with his pretty daughter (Diane Clare), who catches the eye of the local squire (John Carson). As<em> The Plague of the Zombies </em>cautions, wherever there's a rich guy with an unwholesome interest in \"voodoo\" (1966 British movie = not exactly culturally sensitive), walking corpses will soon follow. A crucial graveyard scene, which sees multiple ghouls creep up through the dirt, perfectly captures the exquisite terror of being pursued by something very slow-moving; it also offers a textbook demo on why you should always go for the head when you're trying to fend off the undead. Filmmaker Jos\u00e9 Mojica Marins\u2013known far and wide by horror fans by the name of his alter ego, Coffin Joe\u2013launched himself into instant notoriety with what's considered <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/this-trailer-for-brazilian-teen-horror-movie-kill-me-pl-1797944248#!\">Brazil's first horror film</a>. It's the grim tale of an undertaker named Z\u00e9 do Caix\u00e3o, or Coffin Joe, whose quest to find a suitable woman to bear what he believes will be his supernaturally gifted child leads him down a very dark path. Clad in Coffin Joe's signature top hat and cape, Mojica Marins gleefully rips up the scenery of his own movie. But even though Coffin Joe is a beastly, bullying menace throughout, that glorious title\u2013which is <em>realllly</em> more of a threat\u2013drops a pretty bold hint about his fate. The full title of Jack Hill's pitch-black comedy is <em>Spider Baby, or The Maddest Story Ever Told</em>, and the movie more than lives up. It's about the Merrye family, all of whom suffer from a disorder so unique it's named for them: \"Merrye Syndrome.\" Basically, it means you start aging in reverse once you hit your tween years, eventually transforming into a feral, sub-human sort of creature. They've been keeping to themselves, attacking the occasional unfortunate delivery person here and there, but trouble eventually arrives when some greedy but otherwise \"normal\" distant relations barge their way into Merryes' rundown mansion. <em>Big</em> mistake. The cast features horror icons <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/10-werewolf-movies-to-watch-before-the-next-full-moon-1839307823\">Lon Chaney Jr.</a> and <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/cult-movie-icon-sid-haig-has-passed-away-1838362508\">Sid Haig</a>, but <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-50-spookiest-kids-in-horror-movies-ranked-1781681290\">the standout character is Virginia</a>, played by Jill Banner, whose nickname is \"Spider Baby\" because not only does she love spiders, she acts a lot like one too, which is indeed as disturbing as it sounds. In a bizarre incident, a town's entire population suddenly passes out cold\u2013only to revive a few hours later. Not long after, every woman within the right age range realizes she's knocked up, a worrisome development to say the least, and things only get worse once the kids are born and mature at an accelerated rate into pale-blonde, emotionless, telepathic, hive-minded little monsters. Oh yes, <em>and </em>they're also homicidal maniacs. Their parents are thrust into the uncomfortable position of fearing their own offspring, and then into the even ickier position of needing to destroy them all. <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-50-spookiest-kids-in-horror-movies-ranked-1781681290\">Spooky kids are now a horror movie trope</a>, but these glowing-eyed imps are among the OGs, and they're just as alarming now, even 60 years after making their debut. Exploitation master <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/rip-cult-movie-director-herschell-gordon-lewis-the-god-1787095239\">Herschell Gordon Lewis</a>, also known as the \"Godfather of Gore,\" cranked out several future cult movies in the 1960s, including <em>Two Thousand Maniacs!</em>, <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/10-horror-films-that-contain-equally-horrifying-works-o-1832198507\"><em>Color Me Blood Red</em></a>, and the immortal <em>Blood Feast</em>. But <em>The Gruesome Twosome</em> is a particularly off-the-wall entry, even for Lewis. It's about a sweet old lady who runs a wig shop out of her house, which is also occupied by her childlike adult son and \"Napoleon,\" her pet stuffed leopard. To make a little extra money, she rents out a room in the house to local college girls. Just kidding! That's just how she lures fresh heads to supply her \"100 percent human hair wigs.\" <em>Gruesome </em>is right there in the name, and with Lewis behind the lens, you know the scalping scenes are going to be gushing with fake blood the color of bright-red poster paint. You also know there's going to be terrible acting, a cheerful tone despite all the exaggerated violence, and some glorious plot tangents. Who's up for a rock n' roll beach party? Georges Franju's elegant body-horror masterpiece is remarkably light on gore, considering it's about a doctor (Pierre Brasseur) who sends his female accomplice (Alida Valli) out to kidnap beautiful women, searching for an unwilling face-transplant donor for his disfigured daughter, Christiane (Edith Scob). After multiple failed surgeries, Christiane begins to lose her mind, feeling massive guilt over the dead women and depression over having to hide out and pretend to be dead, unable to tell her fianc\u00e9 she's actually alive. Adding to the atmosphere of eerie madness, Christiane spends most of the movie wearing a blank white mask, freezing her face in an expressionless stare that's far more haunting than any scar could ever be.", "entities": ["Star Trek", "Two Thousand Maniacs!", "The Gruesome Twosome", "Blood Feast", "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?", "Spider Baby", "Psycho", "The Outer Limits", "Alien", "The Masque of the Red Death", "or The Maddest Story Ever Told", "Big", "Rosemary's Baby", "Night of the Living Dead", "The Plague of the Zombies", "Color Me Blood Red", "The Twilight Zone", "Carnival of Souls", "Battle Royale"]}, "https://io9.gizmodo.com/shazams-director-releases-a-new-short-film-about-a-horr-1843542527": {"title": "Shazam Director Releases a Short About a Spooky Home Invasion", "content": "There aren't many things scarier than facing months or years of social distancing, especially when you're stuck in your house by yourself.

The first one, \"<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/403126749\" >Shadowed</a>,\" starred Losten as a woman being stalked by a mysterious entity. This follow-up, \"Not Alone in Here,\" likewise stars Losten facing a different and perhaps scarier threat. It starts with Losten's character locking her front door\u2013or at least remembering she locked the door\u2013before returning to see it wide open. She spends the rest of the film in a panic, moving from room to room with a knife in hand, trying to see if she's really in danger or it's all in her head. What is the truth? You'll have to watch to find out. It's a fear so many of us can relate to. Thinking someone has snuck into your home, believing you're being followed, or something else that puts your health and safety at risk. Oftentimes, we try to convince ourselves that nothing is wrong, or that we are prepared to face the threat if one exists. And during a time when our homes feel like the only safe place we have left, this kind of horror feels extra scary. It's no surprise Sandberg latched onto this subject for his latest short film. His 2013 monster-in-the-dark short <em>Lights Out\u2013</em>which he later transformed into <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/this-new-horror-movie-says-you-were-right-to-be-afraid-1767276296\">his debut feature film</a>\u2013was an early indicator of how incredibly good he is at preying on our everyday fears. Sandberg is set to helm a sequel to <em>Shazam</em>, which has been <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/batman-falls-back-flash-runs-forward-in-warner-bros-l-1842965180\">delayed</a> because of the pandemic.

In fact, I would very much like to move into their house, which is huge, surrounded by trees, and oozes with moody, tasteful affluence. There's even a fireplace in the bathroom, lending the de rigueur \"spooky bath\" scene (why do women in horror movies always take baths when things start to get tense?) an enviable air of luxury. However, since this is a movie, not a Restoration Hardware catalog, ugly things begin to poke their way into this bubble of aesthetic perfection\u2013and as we soon learn, things weren't really all that perfect to begin with. Kevin's preferred style of hands-off parenting is a convenient match for the fact that his job keeps him out of the house all day. Beth and her son, however, have plenty of together time\u2013something that increases when Josh's sudden onset of severe behavioral problems gets him kicked out of school.

But the situation is no less distressing for his mother\u2013Connor Tracy perfectly conveys an agonizing mix of guilt and outrage\u2013since he won't take any responsibility. Instead, he blames everything on the influence of his new invisible friend, who goes by \"Z\" and has commandeered all of the child's playtime, while demanding (via Josh) crust-cut-off sandwiches and glasses of two-percent milk at mealtimes. After the suspension and a grim accident (or <em>was</em> it?) involving one of social pariah Josh's former real-world friends, Kevin and Beth finally consult a psychiatrist\u2013though <em>Z </em>prefers to keep the focus turned inward, leaving the family to grapple with a problem that's way worse than they initially realize. Beth, meanwhile, is dealing with her semi-estranged mother's recent passing after a long illness; she has a certain amount of help from her younger sister, but (perhaps not surprisingly) zero support from Kevin. Cleaning out her childhood home jogs some memories she'd banished to the darkest corners of her brain. The <em>Z</em> trailer actually gives away what counts for a twist in the movie, which is hardly a unique one (three words: <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/imaginary-friends-are-the-new-werewolves-5231334\"><em>Drop Dead Fred</em></a>; <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/channel-zero-creator-nick-antosca-talks-the-dream-door-1829939913\"><em>Channel Zero</em></a> fans, here's two more for you: \"<a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/channel-zeros-creepy-contortionist-is-all-good-acting-1830058313\">Pretzel Jack</a>\"); the movie's overarching themes about childhood trauma creeping in to disrupt a carefully arranged adult life are also not especially original. But the script\u2013by director Christensen and Colin Minihan <em>(Grave Encounters, It Stains the Sands Red)</em>\u2013makes an impact beyond that reveal, which is to say that even if the Z-Beth-Josh connection doesn't shock you, there are certain other plot elements poised to unsettle the hell out of you. <em>Z</em> is now streaming on Shudder.", "entities": ["Bates Motel", "Still/Born", "Grave Encounters", "The Babadook", "Drop Dead Fred", "Channel Zero", "The Omen"]}, "https://io9.gizmodo.com/monster-squads-star-remembers-feeding-the-mummy-and-oth-1843346024": {"title": "Monster Squad Behind the Scenes Memories From Star Andre Gower", "content": "A group of <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/in-a-summer-without-blockbusters-the-bon-appetit-test-1843241506?rev=1588616570998\">friends teams up</a> to defeat the greatest collection of villains ever assembled.

It follows the making of the film, its reception, and, most importantly, its resurrection as a cult classic. The film features interviews with dozens of people involved including director Dekker, co-writer Black and, full disclosure, yours truly, as a <em>Monster Squad</em> superfan and art collector. \"Here's what I always come back to,\" Gower told io9 on a phone call last week. \"Would I have rather been in a summer hit in 1987 that no one cares about or remembers, or would I rather <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/heres-what-the-predator-was-actually-supposed-to-be-abo-1836318925?_ga=2.163718271.1763297990.1588616287-1982811367.1584376436\">still have an impact</a> with people 30 years later and see the effect it has on them? And that's a no brainer. Not many people get to deal with something like that.\" Being as the world feels like it's filled with all kinds of monsters these days, we asked Gower to give us <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/things-are-getting-hilariously-80s-on-these-new-monster-1773453265?_ga=2.163718271.1763297990.1588616287-1982811367.1584376436\">some fun stories</a> from the set of <em>The Monster Squad. </em> One of the biggest highlights of making the movie for Gower was working with the actors who played the monsters, such as Duncan Regehr as Dracula and Tom Noonan as Frankenstein's monster. Except, there was a twist. \"We never saw [them] out of character or out of costume or makeup,\" Gower said. \"I had to go home and go to my local video store to go rent <em>Manhunter</em> so I could see what Tom Noonan looked like, because I'd [been working with] him for like a month and a half and didn't know what the human being looked like. Once I did that I joked that I wish I hadn't because he's scary as shit in that movie.\" As a kid (heck, even as an adult) seeing big explosions and awesome effects in a movie is exciting. But imagine seeing those things in person. \"The experience of being on the set as an observer was amazing,\" Gower said. \"The creature effects and actors in the suits and explosions and things like that. Usually, kids got to see it in the movie theater, they didn't get to see it happen [in reality].\" He also loved shooting <em>Monster Squad </em>all over the Los Angeles area including multiple studio lots. \"We were in all these places famous movies were shot,\" Gower said, mentioning Culver Studios, the Universal lot, and the Warner Bros. lot. \"Westerns and lagoon movies and <em>Gilligan's Island</em>, things like that. It was neat to be part of the overall fabric of Hollywood movie-making.\" One week, while shooting on the Universal lot, catering for the production was inside a saloon on the Western section of the lot. I'll let Gower take it from there. \"You walked in and pretended you were a cowboy doing a Western, which I've always wanted to do. And Michael MacKay, who was the mummy, it takes so long for these guys to get in and out of their makeup and costume. Even Michael MacKay had at least an hour and a half getting into that outfit because there was a half-face prosthetic with the fake teeth coming out that are all glued. The wrapping was all hand done and that was an amazing, amazing build,\" he told us. \"I think everyone discounts the mummy but you need to look at it. It is amazing. Everyone looks at Creature and Wolfman but I'm like \u2018Have you looked at the other one?'\" He continued, \"I remember we were eating, it was Salisbury steak and Michael couldn't see to feed himself. So we sat there and fed him steak, moving the plastic fork around his bandages and out of the way so it wouldn't drip. We'd move his fake teeth so he could eat a little food. And then I believe Michael Faustino (who played Eugene) ended up palling around with him and would give him drinks like soda with a straw.\" When I was growing up, I thought one of the coolest things in <em>The Monster Squad </em>was the kids' epic treehouse. It was massive, filled with awesome posters and toys, and I wanted one so badly. Well, according to Gower, it actually existed and was impressive even then. \"That was neat, to realize that all these craftsmen and these guild people built that treehouse in a tree out in Santa Clarita and then you come back and there's a replica of it on a stage,\" he said. \"I'm like \u2018Wow, that's really cool. That's how movies are made. This is bitchin'.'\" Over the past several years, Gower, along with co-writer Henry Darrow McComas, has been working on a documentary called <em>Wolfman's Got Nards</em>, named after the film's most iconic line. Because I'm in the doc I won't speak to the film's quality (<em>ahem</em>, it rules), but making it gave Gower one more super-powerful behind the scenes <em>Monster Squad </em>memory.<br/> \"The thing I've enjoyed is meeting an individual fan or a group of fans and them telling you why this movie means something to them, and it's a rainbow of connections,\" Gower began, quickly joking it's not an actual rainbow connection. \"At the very beginning, I thought people liked the movie because it was kind of nostalgic and culty and monstery when they first saw it. But they all really dive deep down into certain characters or themes or archetypes or situations. They all make some sort of connection to either their own personal life, their group of friends, their parent's relationships or their siblings and it just started to flood. And when you open up your mind to absorb all that, it's really fascinating and that's really where the doc started to take flight.\" <em>Wolfman's Got Nards </em>does not currently have distribution but Gower is optimistic fans will see it soon.

So when authentically scary things happen in reality, it feels, well, surreal. Michael Dougherty, the writer and director behind <em>Godzilla: King of the Monsters </em>as well as a bunch of other stuff, gets that. So he recently shared a video cutting together moments from horror and science fiction that connect to <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/open-channel-are-you-rushing-to-get-back-to-movie-thea-1843164967?_ga=2.259109256.347709966.1588978182-1743227139.1582387770\">our present reality</a>, that serve as touchstones for him and likely for many of us as we try to make sense of what's happening in the world around us.

Turns out, we've been telling stories about these sorts of things for a long time. And now those stories can help us manage.

As reported by <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/stephen-king-movie-revival-mike-flanagan-doctor-sleep-director-attached-1202930038/\" >Deadline</a>, Flanagan, also known for his work on Netflix's fantastic <em>The Haunting of Hill House </em>and its followup, <em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em>, is working on adapting the 2013 Stephen King novel Revival, with an option to direct if he so chooses. Inspired, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/stephen-king-exclusive-read-an-excerpt-from-new-book-revival-20141027\" >King has said</a>, by stories like <em>Frankenstein </em>and Arthur Machen's <em>The Great God Pan</em>, <em>Revival </em>is the story of Reverend Charles Jacobs, a minister in a small town of Maine who becomes obsessed with a boy named Jamie Morton. Whatever happens between the two, it does not go well, and decades later Jamie, now a traveling musician, meets Charles Jacobs again, and, well, bad, demonic events happen. Horror stuff, you know. The novel was criticized for being a bit meandering, but that isn't an uncommon thing with King. And Flanagan has <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-3-hour-cut-of-doctor-sleep-is-on-the-way-1840542698\">shown a knack</a> for trimming down and simultaneously elaborating King's material in a way that benefits it, adding depth and complexity alongside some welcome focus. Flanagan will be developing the film alongside producer Trevor Macy; the two work have worked together with the independent production company Intrepid Pictures. <em>Doctor Sleep</em>, all things considered, did pretty well, as Deadline points out, making $72.3 million worldwide. We'll see how Flanagan can manage with a lesser-known King property.", "entities": ["Doctor Sleep", "The Shining", "Revival", "The Haunting of Hill House"]}}
